# Front End for iGive App

## Project details:

For our School of Code final project, we created iGive, a community focused food giving app to help reduce food waste in the local community.

Front end hosted here: https://igive.netlify.app/. This repo contains the code deployed to netlify.

This project was implemented using an agile process.

The Problem:
**Situation:** As boot campers we we’re asked to design an app to solve a problem that we thought stood out for our final four week project.

**Task:** Working in a team of 6, we used the Disney ideation approach on Miro to ideate all our ideas through the dreamer, realist and critic room. As a team, we all agreed with designing an application to reduce waste. This decision was partly based on all of our personal experiences and so we wanted to make a difference not only for ourselves but so many others in our community.

**Action:** To have stronger evidence for our idea, we did some background research into food waste in the UK and found that food waste is one of the largest contributors to climate change. We also created some user stories for different types of users which allowed us to focus on the user’s needs throughout the project, and also designed wireframes using Figma to get a better vision of our app.

**Result:** The solution that we created for our users was called iGive, which is a community sharing app allowing people to share their unwanted food items which could be useful elsewhere. iGive is a full stack web app built using many technologies and tools. We wanted to make sure we could achieve our MVP, so leveraged the tech learnt during our time at school of code.

We wanted to leverage the tech we learned from the boot camp. So for this project, we decided to work with NEXT.JS.
For our databases we explored mongoDB but eventually landed on postgreSQL with heroku because the data we wanted to store would benefit from a relational database.
One of the main aspects of our app was how to simplify our image handling process, which led us to cloudinary, which we used for cloud based image storage and management.
In terms of testing, we used jest and supertest to write unit and integration tests for our backend API. And for the front end we used cypress for end-to-end tests.
For our planning and designing tools such as figma, canva, miro and trello were utilised. We also decided to use Auth0 for authentication.
